# My Git Assignment
This is a change in dev

This was my first time using Git and GitHub, and it was a bit intimidating at first, especially since I had to use the terminal on my MacBook. I'm not very familiar with the terminal, and I was nervous about making mistakes. The process felt complex at the beginning, and I struggled to understand how the commands were working, especially since I hadn’t worked with Git before.

However, it was really fascinating to see how I could use the terminal to interact with my GitHub account. Cloning the repository, making commits, and pushing changes were all processes that I never expected to do through the terminal, and it was exciting to watch everything come together. Although it was challenging, I could see how powerful Git is for version control and managing my code.

I'm still getting used to the language and commands, and I want to understand more deeply how each command works in the background. It’s still a little confusing at times, but I know that with more practice, I’ll become more comfortable and confident using Git and the terminal. Overall, this experience was very rewarding, and I'm looking forward to getting better at using Git in the future.
